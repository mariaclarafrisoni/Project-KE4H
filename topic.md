The project centers on the **[Castle of Fénis]**(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9nis_Castle), one of the best-preserved examples of medieval residential architecture in the Aosta Valley, Italy. Unlike defensive fortresses, Fénis was built by the [Challant family](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challant_(famiglia)) in the 14th century as a prestigious home, known for its symmetrical towers, internal courtyard, wooden elements, and a remarkable cycle of [frescoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresco) that reflect medieval symbolism and cultural values.

Fénis Castle is already represented in [ArCo](https://w3id.org/arco), the Italian [knowledge graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph) for cultural heritage. ArCo provides [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) descriptions of cultural entities using ontologies based on [OWL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language), enabling machine-readable knowledge extraction. However, the current semantic description of the castle could be expanded with additional data to enhance its accessibility, interpretation, and value in educational or digital settings.

This project explores the castle as a case study for **digital knowledge enrichment**, examining how [Linked Data principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data), [Natural Language Generation (NLG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_generation), and [Large Language Models (LLMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) can support cultural heritage research. Through Fénis, we aim to show how historical narratives can be reconstructed and expanded using semantic technologies, while also identifying gaps in existing knowledge graphs.

The presence of Fénis Castle in the [ArCo ontology](https://w3id.org/arco/ontology) makes it a suitable candidate for semantic experimentation. Its features—such as its iconographic program, symbolic architecture, and role in tourism—highlight the importance of enriching its digital representation, both to support <u>academic inquiry</u> and to <u>improve public engagement with cultural content</u>.
