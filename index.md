# Project KE4H: Knowledge Graph Enrichment

In this project, we explored the ontology of the [ARCO knowledge graph](https://w3id.org/arco) to investigate how cultural heritage data is represented. Using SPARQL queries, we examined classes and properties related to historical buildings and monuments.

During our exploration, we identified several missing pieces of information about the [Fénis Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9nis_Castle), a castle in Northern Italy. To enrich the knowledge graph, we used Large Language Models ([ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) and [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com)) to generate RDF triples containing relevant data. These triples were designed to complement the existing ontology while maintaining consistency with ARCO’s vocabulary.

The project also involved evaluating the outputs generated by the LLMs and refining the prompts to improve their accuracy and usefulness.
