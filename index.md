# Unlocking Fénis: prompting the past with LLMs, enriching the present with ArCo

In this project, we explored the ontology of the [ARCO knowledge graph](https://w3id.org/arco) to investigate how [cultural heritage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_heritage) data is represented. Using [**SPARQL queries**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL), we examined classes and properties related to historical buildings and monuments.

During our exploration, we identified several missing pieces of information about the [Fénis Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9nis_Castle), a castle in [Northern Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Italy). To enrich the **knowledge graph**, we used <u>Large Language Models</u> ([ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) and [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com)) to generate [**RDF triples**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_triple) containing relevant data. These triples were designed to complement the existing ontology while maintaining consistency with ARCO’s vocabulary.

The project also involved evaluating the outputs generated by the [LLMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) and refining the [prompts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering) to improve their accuracy and usefulness.
