# Conclusions

This project provided valuable insights into the modeling and enrichment of cultural heritage data using the ArCo ontology and Linked Open Data principles. The key conclusion we can draw from this project is that working with AI chatbots can significantly support the handling of complex and structured tasks, such as generating SPARQL queries and RDF triples. Throughout its development, we encountered several <u>challenges</u> that shaped our process and helped us grow both technically and methodologically:

- **Source reliability**: It was necessary to identify trustworthy sources for cultural heritage data, which required time and careful evaluation to avoid inaccuracies. Ensuring the credibility of our sources was crucial to maintain the overall quality of the dataset.

- **Modeling precision**: Ensuring precision and consistency while modeling data according to ArCo required careful planning, constant verification, and a high degree of precision. Particular attention was paid to the correct use of classes, properties, and links to existing entities.

- **Usability limitations**: The current reliance on SPARQL queries to explore the ArCo dataset presents a usability challenge. Introducing a more user-friendly system with a search box that doesnâ€™t rely solely on queries could greatly improve accessibility, especially for users without technical backgrounds.

- **Topic selection**: Choosing the topic for our project was challenging, since we had to find a subject both culturally relevant and, at the same time, underrepresented in the ArCo ontology, with "gaps". Therefore, we had to balance historical importance, data availability and the potential for meaningful enrichment.
But finally we made it! And we ended up being very proud of our choice... next trip for us: Castello di FÃ©nis in the Aosta Valley ðŸ˜‰
